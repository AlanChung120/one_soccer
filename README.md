# onesoccer

Motive:
After learning Python in grade 10 computer science and learning Python from a book, I wanted to make a game to test my abilities and
understanding. I also thought it would be a fun little hobby to do whenever I had time. 

I used Python 3.6.2 and Pygame 1.9.4 to create this game, and for my text editor I used Atom. The game successfully worked on Windows 10.

This is a simple one on one soccer game made with pygame where the player's objective is to score as many goals as possible on the other 
player's net.   
Click play to play   
when play is clicked player is able to move, goals will be tracked on the top left (player 1) and right (player 2) corner.  
After 90 seconds the game will stop and display the winner. To play again simply press play again.  

Controls:  
Player 1 (player initially on the left):  
left arrow key - move left  
right arrow key - move right  
up arrow key - jump  

Player 2 (player initally on the right):  
a - move left  
d - move right  
w - jump  


To run this game you need to download Python (3 or greater): https://www.python.org/downloads/  
Also you will need to download Pygame: http://kidscancode.org/blog/2015/09/pygame_install/  
After that run command prompt   
Change directory to the location of one soccer game folder   
Then type "python one_soccer.py"  
Enjoy!
